Two slides used in Aptiv, GÃ¶teborg,intro to sensor fusion basical algorithms: Bayesian filter principle, Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman, particle filter. 
 
(In case anyone is interested in joining in, send email to chisyliu@hotmail.com)I also plan to add some demo codes to illustrate how KF, EKF, UKF and PF works in sensor fusion, especially with radar and lidar
