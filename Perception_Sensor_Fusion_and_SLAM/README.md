I plan to add the presentation held for sharing the basic algorithm and models in Sensor Fusion and SLAM scenario in sensor fusion algorithm team, Aptiv, GÃ¶teborg. 

Algorithms introduced for sensor fusion: Bayesian filter principle, Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman, particle filter.

(In case anyone is interested in joining in, send email to chisyliu@hotmail.com)I also plan to add some demo codes to illustrate how KF, EKF, UKF and PF works in sensor fusion, especially with radar and lidar
